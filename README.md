# Java Synchronization
# Syncronization-using-Semaphore

It is required to simulate a limited number of devices connected to a router’s Wi-Fi using
Java threading and semaphore. Routers can be designed to limit the number of open
connections. For example, a Router may wish to have only N connections at any point in
time. As soon as N connections are made, the Router will not accept other incoming
connections until an existing connection is released. Explain how semaphores can be
used by a Router to limit the number of concurrent connections

The following rules should be applied:
➔ The Wi-Fi number of connected devices is initially empty.
➔ If a client is logged in (print a message that a client has logged in) and if it can be served
➔ (means that it can reach the internet), then the client should perform the following
activities:
◆ Connect
◆ Perform online activity
◆ Log out
➔ Note: these actions will be represented by printed messages, such that there is a
random
➔ waiting time between the printed messages when a client connects, do some online
➔ activities and logged out.
➔ If a client arrives and all connections are occupied, it must wait until one of the currently
➔ available clients finish his service and leave.
➔ After a client finishes his service, he leave and one of the waiting clients (if exist) will
➔ connect to the internet.

You program must contain the following classes:
1. Router Class: that contains a list of connections and methods to occupy a
connection and release a connection.
2. Semaphore Class: as given the synchronization lab.
3. Device Class: represent different devices (threads) that can be connected to the
router;
each device has its own name (i.e. C1) and type (i.e. mobile, pc, tablet...) and it may
perform three activities: connect, perform online activity and disconnect/logout.
4. Network Class: this class contains the main method in which the user is asked
for two
inputs:
● N: max number of connections a router can accept
● TC: total number of devices that wish to connect).
● TC lines that contain: name of each device, and its type

 Program Output
You will print the output logs in a file, which simulates the execution order of the devices threads
and the printed messages of each device
NOTE THAT: This is just an example not the only scenario that can be applied.
 Sample Input
What is the number of WI-FI Connections?
2
What is the number of devices Clients want to connect?
4
C1 mobile
C2 tablet
C3 pc
C4 pc
 Sample Output
- (C1)(mobile)arrived
- (C2)(tablet)arrived
- Connection 1: C1 Occupied
- Connection 2: C2 Occupied
- C4(pc) arrived and waiting
- C3(pc)arrived and waiting
- Connection 1: C1 login
- Connection 1: C1 performs online activity
- Connection 2: C2 login
- Connection 2: C2 performs online activity
- Connection 1: C1 Logged out
- Connection 1 : C4 Occupied
- Connection 1 : C4 log in
- Connection 1 : C4 performs online activity
- Connection 2: C2 Logged out
- Connection 2: C3 Occupied
